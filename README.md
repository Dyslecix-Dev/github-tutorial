# Github Tutorial

## Description

This is a tutorial for Github.

## Terminology

- Branch - A parallel version of a repository. By default every repository has one branch named main. Creating additional branches copies the main branch and allows the user to make any changes without disrupting the main branch. Normally, branches are used to work on specific features.
- GitHub - A collaboration platform that uses Git for versioning.
- Merge - Adds the changes in a pull request and branch into the main branch.
- Pull Request - Shows the changes in a branch to other people and allows them to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch.
- Repository - A project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of these files and folders.
